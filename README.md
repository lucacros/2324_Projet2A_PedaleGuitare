- Audio Effect → Space → Localization → distance → **Reverberation**
- Audio Effect → Space → Room → Echo → **Granular Delay**

## 🛠 Musical Effects

Explaining how we built our effects, understanding the physics of the signal modulation, modification.

### 🎶 Reverberation


### 🎛️ Granular Delay


## 🔧 Which IDE ?

After trying to code an IN/OUT audio in C++ with the library "portaudio", I was pushed on the Audio IDE way by my professor... 

### FAUST

## 💻  Implementation

To implemente an effect, I will follow these three steps : 

- Effect Conception
- User interface
- Tests and adjustments
