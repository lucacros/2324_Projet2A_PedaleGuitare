- A.F.E = Analog Front End : Preamplifier-Noise attenuation
- A.R.E = Analog Rear End : Amplifier-Noise attenuation

We use AFE to adapt the voltage to the Codec = 2.83Vpp for a supply voltage of 3.3V. To find out if you need to fit an AFE, you need to measure the signal from your guitar.

**<p align="center"> Guitar signal </p>**

As you can see, the guitar signal is within the value range of the codec and is important enough not to use AFE and ARE.

The block diagram can be simplified.
Once the block diagram has been constructed, we can adapt it to the components used:

Pour obtenir ces niveaux de tensions nous utilisons plusieurs r√©gulateurs de tensions. Le premier r√©gulateur  est un r√©gulateur √† d√©coupage

### Switching power supply
The 17950x78 integrates both the input and output capacitors. Therefore, additional external input and output capacitors are normally not required.
The additional 100¬µF capacitor C1 is mounted as termination of the supply line and provides a slight damping of possible oscillations of the series resonance circuit represented by the inductance of the supply line and the input capacitance. This capacitor also prevents voltage overshoot during start up. the capacitor C3 allows fine tuning of load transcient voltage response.

### Linear power supply

## Audio Codec Configuration

The SGTL5000 is a digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) audio codec. Its basic operation involvesconverting analog signals to digital for audio input and converting digital audio signals to analog for audio output. The essential pins include those for I2S communication, power supply, mode selection, audio input and output connections, as well as control pins to configure the codec based on application requirements.
Using the microcontroller, we will control the I2C codec and transmit the signals in I2S.

### Power Section
To begin, we need to supply 2 different voltages: the first +3.3V to supply VDDA (for analogue part) and VDDIO (for Inputs/Outputs) and the second +1.8V to supply VDDD (for digital part).

|   Components   |   Voltages |  Descriptor |
|---    |:-:    |:-    | 
|   VDDIO   |   +3.3V   | Power supply controls the digital I/O levels as well as the output level of LINE outputs. | 
| VDDD   |   +1.8V  | power supply controls the digital I/O levels as well as the output level of LINE outputs   |
|  VDDA  |   +3.3V   | Power supply is used for the internal analog circuitry including ADC, DAC, LINE inputs, MIC inputs, headphone outputs and reference voltages.|

### Configuration
#### Clock
The SGTL5000 clock is available at SYS_MCLK. SYS_MCLK must be synchronised with the sampling rate (Fs) of the I2S port. 
#### I2C
#### I2S

## üíª Installation
I recommend downloading the latest version of **KiCad** to reproduce the electronic board. For simulating amplifiers, consider using **Cadence Pspice** or **Microcap**. Use the **STCUBEIDE** software for programming the codec and microprocessor.
