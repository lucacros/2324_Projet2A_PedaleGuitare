- A.F.E = Analog Front End : Preamplifier-Noise attenuation
- A.R.E = Analog Rear End : Amplifier-Noise attenuation

We use AFE to adapt the voltage to the Codec = 2.83Vpp for a supply voltage of 3.3V. To find out if you need to fit an AFE, you need to measure the signal from your guitar.

**<p align="center"> Guitar signal </p>**

As you can see, the guitar signal is within the value range of the codec and is important enough not to use AFE and ARE.

The block diagram can be simplified.
Once the block diagram has been constructed, we can adapt it to the components used:

Pour obtenir ces niveaux de tensions nous utilisons plusieurs r√©gulateurs de tensions. Le premier r√©gulateur  est un r√©gulateur √† d√©coupage

### Switching power supply
The 17950x78 integrates both the input and output capacitors. Therefore, additional external input and output capacitors are normally not required.
The additional 100¬µF capacitor C1 is mounted as termination of the supply line and provides a slight damping of possible oscillations of the series resonance circuit represented by the inductance of the supply line and the input capacitance. This capacitor also prevents voltage overshoot during start up. the capacitor C3 allows fine tuning of load transcient voltage response.

### Linear power supply

## Audio Codec 

The SGTL5000 is a digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) audio codec. Its basic operation involvesconverting analog signals to digital for audio input and converting digital audio signals to analog for audio output. The essential pins include those for I2S communication, power supply, mode selection, audio input and output connections, as well as control pins to configure the codec based on application requirements.
Using the microcontroller, we will control the I2C codec and transmit the signals in I2S.

### Power Section
To begin, we need to supply 2 different voltages: the first +3.3V to supply VDDA (for analogue part) and VDDIO (for Inputs/Outputs) and the second +1.8V to supply VDDD (for digital part).

|---    |:-:    |:-    | 
|   VDDIO   |   +3.3V   | Power supply controls the digital I/O levels as well as the output level of LINE outputs. | 
| VDDD   |   +1.8V  | power supply controls the digital I/O levels as well as the output level of LINE outputs   |
|  VDDA  |   +3.3V   | Power supply is used for the internal analog circuitry including ADC, DAC, LINE inputs, MIC inputs, headphone outputs and reference voltages.|

### Configuration
The codec is clocked at the same frequency as the microprocessor. It communicates via I2C  and transmits its audio data in I2S.

## MicroProcessor 

The microprocessor is a crucial component in the guitar pedal system, responsible for controlling various functions, processing audio signals, and managing communication with other components. In this section, we'll delve into the specifications and details related to the microprocessor.

### MicroProcessor Pins
The microprocessor interacts with other components through various pins. Here are some essential pins and their functions:
### Power Supply Pins
|   Pins   |   Voltages |  
|---    |:-:    |    
|   VDDIO   |   +3.3V   |   
| VDDD   |   +1.8V  |   
|  VDDA  |   +3.3V   | 



### Communication with RAM
The STM32F446ZC communicates with the RAM to handle memory operations. RAM is crucial for storing and accessing data during signal processing.

### Communication with Audio Codec
The microprocessor communicates with the audio codec (SGTL5000) using I2C for control and I2S for audio data transmission. The codec is responsible for converting analog signals to digital and vice versa.

## üíª Installation
I recommend downloading the latest version of **KiCad** to reproduce the electronic board. For simulating amplifiers, consider using **Cadence Pspice** or **Microcap**. Use the **STCUBEIDE** software for programming the codec and microprocessor.
