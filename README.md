## 💻 Installation
I recommend downloading the latest version of **KiCad** to reproduce the electronic board. For simulating amplifiers, consider using **Cadence Pspice** or **Microcap**. Use the **STCUBEIDE** software for programming the codec and microprocessor.

- **Pspice**: [Download Pspice](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/pcb-design-and-analysis/analog-mixed-signal-simulation/pspice.html)
