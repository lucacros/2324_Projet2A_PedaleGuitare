# Organisation du groupe 
- Agile Method
- EXCEL : GANTT

To better organize our project, we have drawn up a task breakdown with each associated deliverable. This diagram is an integration of the WBS, OBS, and PBS charts.

- WBS = Work Breakdown Structure: hierarchical structures that break down complex operations into more manageable components
- PBS = Project Breakdown Structure: product organization chart: deliverables, breakdown, intermediate outputs
- OBS = Organization Breakdown Structure: How tasks are organized. The skills, responsibilities, relationships, etc. Individualization of tasks
